## What is Tic-Tac-Toe?

Tic-Tac-Toe is a **classic two-player strategy game** played on a **3Ã—3 grid**. Players take turns placing **X** or **O** in an empty cell, aiming to form a **horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line** with three of their marks. The game is simple to learn but involves strategic thinking to **block the opponent** and create a winning move. It is commonly used to teach **basic game logic and AI algorithms** in programming.
